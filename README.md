# RePTaRprototype

We conceptualized, created, and trialed a prototype of a remote passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag reader (RePTaR) for use in obtaining individual identity scans of brown treesnakes (*Boiga irregularis*) on Gu&aring;han. We investigated if this setup could help remotely scan individuals in a laboratory setting with hopes of eventual use of RePTaR in the field to augment monitoring work being done in targeted study areas. We denoted scanning success (1 = scan, 0 = no scan) every time a snake got within 2 inches of the antenna of each of unit. Scans (where success = 1) were downloaded from RePTaR microSD cards while scanning success information (1/0) came from processed video recordings from each trial. We approximated distance to scanning and collected information on snake traits and marking location with the PIT tag in order to run logistic regressions investigating what covariates could help describe variation in scanning success.
